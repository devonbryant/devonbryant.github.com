In the [previous](/blog/2013/03/02/fourier-transforms/) post, we looked at the Fourier transform function.  In this post, we'll explore some implementations of this function in Scala and capture some performance metrics.

<!-- more -->

Before we start, we need a data representation for complex numbers and a pure trait to test different FFT functions.  Note that the FFT trait specifies a _Numeric_ type class so it can work with any sequence of numbers.

{% codeblock lang:scala %}
case class Complex(r: Double, i: Double = 0.0) {
  def +(x: Complex) = Complex(r + x.r, i + x.i)
  def -(x: Complex) = Complex(r - x.r, i - x.i)
  def *(x: Complex) = Complex(r * x.r - i * x.i, r * x.i + i * x.r)
}
{% endcodeblock %}

{% codeblock lang:scala %}
trait FFT {
  def fft[A : Numeric](data: Seq[A]): Seq[Complex]
}
{% endcodeblock %}

As mentioned in the previous post, the [Cooley-Turkey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley%E2%80%93Tukey_FFT_algorithm) algorithm requires that the data length be a power of 2.  All of our equations in the previous post were in terms of the complex exponential function (_e<sup>ix</sup>_).  Using _Euler's_ formula we can instead rely on sine and cosine functions in our implementations.

## Recursive Implementation

The recursive nature of the standard Cooley-Turkey algorithm lends itself nicely to a pure functional implementation.  Since we should always prefer pure functional code, we'll start there.


{% codeblock lang:scala %}
object CooleyTurkey extends FFT {
  import scala.math._

  def fft[A](data: Seq[A])(implicit num: Numeric[A]): Seq[Complex] = {
    require((data.length & data.length - 1) == 0)
    
    ditfft2(data map { a => Complex(num.toDouble(a)) })
  }

  private[this] def ditfft2(data: Seq[Complex]): Seq[Complex] = {
    data.length match {
      case 0 => Nil
      case 1 => data
      case n => {
        val evens = ditfft2(filterByIndex(data) { _ % 2 == 0 })
        val odds = ditfft2(filterByIndex(data) { _ % 2 != 0 })
        val phase = for (i <- 0 to n / 2 - 1) yield {
          val p = -2.0 * Pi * i / n
          Complex(cos(p), sin(p))
        }

        val ops = (odds, phase).zipped map { _ * _ }
        val one = (evens, ops).zipped map { _ + _ }
        val two = (evens, ops).zipped map { _ - _ }

        one ++ two
      }
    }
  }
  
  private[this] def filterByIndex[A](a: Seq[A])(p: Int => Boolean) = 
    a.zipWithIndex filter { t => p(t._2) } map { t => t._1 }
}
{% endcodeblock %}

This actually follows the mathematical definition pretty nicely and is very concise and readable.  Note that we are recursively breaking the data into smaller DFTs by even and odd indexes.  We're calculating the phase (twiddle) factors seperately and relying on the symmetric properties of the DFT to recombine the values for _0 &le; k &lt; N/2_ and _N/2 &le; k &lt; N_.

So how well does this algorithm perform?  First try with 1024 random Double values on my machine takes ~ 100 ms.  OK, let's see how this does once the machine warms up.  If we try 10 random sequences in a row (size 1024), we get:

We can see that it's starting to settle.  After running 1000 iterations, we get an average of ~ 3 ms per fft call.

## Imperative Implementation

It's no secret that optimizing Scala code can sometimes be ugly (see Erik Osheim's [Premature Optimization](http://nescala.org/#t-14447186)).  So let's see if we move towards an imperative version of the FFT.

The following is basically a translation of the algorithm from Apache [Commons-Math](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/) into Scala.  This algorithm is still based on the Cooley-Turkey algorithm, but the implementation is much more verbose and harder to follow than the recursive version.

{% codeblock lang:scala %}
object ApacheFFT extends FFT {
  import scala.math._
  
  def fft[A](data: Seq[A])(implicit num: Numeric[A]): Seq[Complex] = {
    require((data.length & data.length - 1) == 0)
    
    val real = (data map { num.toDouble(_) }).toArray
    val imag = Array.ofDim[Double](data.length)
    inPlaceFFT(real, imag)
    (real, imag).zipped map { Complex(_, _) }
  }
  
  private[this] lazy val W_SUB_N_R = (0 to 64) map { i => cos(2 * Pi / pow(2, i)) }
  private[this] lazy val W_SUB_N_I = (0 to 64) map { i => -sin(2 * Pi / pow(2, i)) }

  private[this] def bitReverseShuff(real: Array[Double], imag: Array[Double]) {
    val n = real.length
    val halfOfN = n >> 1
    
    def swap(dv: Array[Double], a: Int, b: Int) = {
      val tmp = dv(a)
      dv(a) = dv(b)
      dv(b) = tmp
    }

    var i, j = 0
    while (i < n) {
      if (i < j) {
        swap(real, i, j)
        swap(imag, i, j)
      }

      var k = halfOfN
      while (k <= j && k > 0) {
        j -= k
        k >>= 1
      }
      j += k
      i += 1
    }
  }
  
  private[this] def inPlaceFFT(real: Array[Double], imag: Array[Double]) {
    val n = real.length
    
    bitReverseShuff(real, imag)
    
    var i0 = 0
    while (i0 < n) {
      val i1 = i0 + 1
      val i2 = i0 + 2
      val i3 = i0 + 3

      val srcR0 = real(i0)
      val srcI0 = imag(i0)
      val srcR1 = real(i2)
      val srcI1 = imag(i2)

      real(i0) = srcR0 + srcR1 + srcR2 + srcR3
      imag(i0) = srcI0 + srcI1 + srcI2 + srcI3

	    real(i1) = srcR0 - srcR2 + (srcI1 - srcI3)
      imag(i1) = srcI0 - srcI2 + (srcR3 - srcR1)

      real(i2) = srcR0 - srcR1 + srcR2 - srcR3
      imag(i2) = srcI0 - srcI1 + srcI2 - srcI3
      
	    real(i3) = srcR0 - srcR2 + (srcI3 - srcI1)
      imag(i3) = srcI0 - srcI2 + (srcR1 - srcR3)
      
      i0 += 4
    }
    
    var lastN0 = 4
    var lastLogN0 = 2
    var n0, logN0 = 0
    var wSubN0R, wSubN0I, wSubN0ToRR, wSubN0ToRI, grR, grI, hrR, hrI, nextWsubN0ToRR, nextWsubN0ToRI = 0.0
    while (lastN0 < n) {
      n0 = lastN0 << 1
      logN0 = lastLogN0 + 1
      wSubN0R = W_SUB_N_R(logN0)
      wSubN0I = W_SUB_N_I(logN0)

      var destEvenStartIndex = 0
      while (destEvenStartIndex < n) {
        val destOddStartIndex = destEvenStartIndex + lastN0
        wSubN0ToRR = 1.0
        wSubN0ToRI = 0.0

        var r = 0
        while (r < lastN0) {

          grI = imag(destEvenStartIndex + r)
          hrR = real(destOddStartIndex + r)
          hrI = imag(destOddStartIndex + r)

          real(destEvenStartIndex + r) = grR + wSubN0ToRR * hrR - wSubN0ToRI * hrI
          imag(destEvenStartIndex + r) = grI + wSubN0ToRR * hrI + wSubN0ToRI * hrR

          real(destOddStartIndex + r) = grR - (wSubN0ToRR * hrR - wSubN0ToRI * hrI)
          imag(destOddStartIndex + r) = grI - (wSubN0ToRR * hrI + wSubN0ToRI * hrR)

          nextWsubN0ToRR = wSubN0ToRR * wSubN0R - wSubN0ToRI * wSubN0I
          nextWsubN0ToRI = wSubN0ToRR * wSubN0I + wSubN0ToRI * wSubN0R
          wSubN0ToRR = nextWsubN0ToRR
          wSubN0ToRI = nextWsubN0ToRI
                    
          r += 1
        }
                
        destEvenStartIndex += n0
      }

      lastN0 = n0
      lastLogN0 = logN0
    }
  }
}
{% endcodeblock %}

Yikes, we went from 30 lines of code to 120.  Let's take a look at a few points in this algorithm though.  Since we are no longer recursively selecting even/odd indexes, we perform a bit-reverse shuffle of the data up front.  This allows us to traverse the data in essentially the same order.  Also, note that the _W<sub>N</sub><sup>k</sup>_ real and imaginary factors are pre-computed.  This, in combination with the fact that we are operating on arrays and avoiding boxing and unboxing will certainly make this algorithm faster.  Let's see how much.

Using the same test as before, our first try with 1024 random samples takes ~ 20 ms.  Next up, let's test with the warmup using 10 iterations:

{% img center /images/fourier/ct_imper_time1.png %}

After 1000 iterations, it takes an average of ~ 0.19 ms per fft call.

## Conclusions

The following table shows a side-by-side comparison of both algorithms.  The times in these tables were averaged from 1000 iterations on increasing frame sizes.

 Frame Size | Recursive Time (ms) | Imperative Time (ms) 
 ---------- | ------------------: | -------------------: 
 512        | 1.56                | 0.14                 
 1024       | 2.98                | 0.19                 
 2048       | 6.04                | 0.27                 
 4096       | 13.18               | 0.47

 The imperative algorithm is clearly faster, but much more verbose and harder to understand.

 Scala gets knocked sometimes for allowing both OO/imperative and functional styles of coding.  In my opinion this is actually a huge benefit for the language.  You can favor the functional style and resort to imperative code in cases where performance is critical.  These cases can be isolated and the details can be hidden.  Looking at our imperative algorithm above, the FFT is still referentially transparent.
