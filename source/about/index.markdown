I'm a software engineer in Colorado.  I work mostly with Complex Event Processing, Predictive Analytics, and Machine Learning systems.  I also work some with Semantic Web and graph database technologies.

I am currently finishing up a masters degree in Computer Science from UCCS.  My main area of research has been Music Information Retrieval.  It's a nice blend of my interests in DSP (my undergraduate degree), music, and machine learning.  My thesis work is focused on distributed audio feature extraction.

I am very interested in functional programming, with Scala being my current language of choice.  I've written a lot of Java code over the years along with some C/C++, Javascript, Matlab, and Python.  I have dabbled a little with Haskell, Clojure, and Prolog as well but not enough to say I know them.
